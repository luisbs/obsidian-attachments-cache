# Settings

The next section explains the supported Settings.

### `Plugging LogLevel`

By default **LogLevel** is set to `'WARN'` this prevents the package from over-logging into the user console.

Changing the **LogLevel** to `'INFO'` or `'DEBUG'` will print to the console valuable information of the inner-workings of the plugging, details about why an URL is/isn't cached, etc.

---

### `Plugin Priority`

The priority affects when the plugin will run in relation to other plugins, by default **Priority** is set to `'NORMAL'`.

> TLDR; if you detect some attachments ignoring cache, change the **Priority** to `'HIGHER'` or _**Cache all posible attachments**_

What this values releated too is the order of the [PostProcessors](https://docs.obsidian.md/Plugins/Editor/Markdown+post+processing), what happens is that in some cases other plugins may run with the same or higher `sortOrder` value than the **AttachmentsCache Plugin**.

The result of that is some attachments not been notice and avoiding been cached.

#### `'LOWER'` or _**Only cache static attachments**_

This mode will only try to cache attachments that are **part of the note content**, ex:

```md
![](https://images.example.net/image1.jpg)
```

But for example if a plugin renderes special elements using **fenced CodeBlocks** they may not be detected by the **AttachmentsCache Plugin**, and the cache will be ignored.

#### `'NORMAL'` or _**Cache majority of attachments**_

This mode will expand `'LOWER'` and try to also cache attachments on views that other plugins generate.

In this case the above example of special elements been rendered will try to cache most plugins artifacts, but it may still not detect somo plugins that make there **PostProcessors** with higher `sortOrder` values.

#### `'HIGHER'` or _**Cache all posible attachments**_

This mode will expand `'NORMAL'` and try to cache most attachments, it may only ignore elements generated by plugins that intentionally try to place there **PostProcessors** as the last ones.

### `Keep Special Characters`

When this setting is disabled any non-standard character is replaced with an underscore, to prevent problems on a paths.

### `URL Param Cache` & `URL Param Ignore`

> This Settings work if the **Note** has already matched an _enabled path_.

URL param, overrides standar cache rules on a per-link basis, and caches/ignores the attachment.
